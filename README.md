# R-for-Crypto

The first code is focused on forecasting the Openning Price of Ripple. The source is coinmarketcap.com and the model is a Neural Network using 2 hidden neurons and 5 neurons as inputs. The package used is called neuralnet.

The forecast uses the five previously openning prices and the output is the day of today.

My performance indicator is the comparison between a moving average using the same period as the number of inputs, in this case, it is equal to 5 as well.

I hope we could get into code improvements that might benefit the crypto investor community and the open source community as well.
